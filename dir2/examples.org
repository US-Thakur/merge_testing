* Show entries with recent timestamps

You can also access these views with the command ~org-ql-view~.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Show entries with any timestamp from last 7 days:
  (org-ql-view-recent-items 7)

  ;; Show entries clocked in last 30 days:
  (org-ql-view-recent-items 30 'clocked)

  ;; Show entries closed in last 30 days:
  (org-ql-view-recent-items 30 'closed)

* Stuck projects block agenda

Reddit user =emptymatrix= [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cnrt2d/orgqlblock_integrates_orgql_into_org_agenda/ewtqez8/][shared]] this example of replacing a traditional =org-stuck-projects= view like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-stuck-projects
        '("+@project/-DONE" ("NEXT") nil "SCHEDULED:"))
#+END_SRC

With this =org-ql-block= agenda view, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        '(("s" "Stuck Projects"
           ((org-ql-block '(and (tags "@project")
                                (not (done))
                                (not (descendants (todo "NEXT")))
                                (not (descendants (scheduled)))))))))
#+END_SRC

* Listing bills coming due

This uses the example in the readme file, but maps across the elements returned by ~org-ql~ to present a simple list of titles and deadlines.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-ql (org-agenda-files)
    (and (not (done))
         (tags "bills")
         (deadline auto))
    :action (list (substring-no-properties (org-get-heading t t))
                  (org-entry-get (point) "DEADLINE"))
    :sort deadline)
  ;;=> (("Electric bill" "<2018-08-23 Thu +1m>")
  ;;    ("Rent" "<2018-09-01 Sat +1m>"))
#+END_SRC

This could also be put in a script, which could use desktop notifications to remind of bills coming due: [[examples/org-bills-due.el][org-bills-due.el]].
