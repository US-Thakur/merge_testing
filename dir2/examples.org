** Showing TO-READ entries containing the word "lisp"

This query would be difficult to write in a standard Org Agenda search, because it matches against a to-do keyword /and/ a plain-text search.  As described in the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html#combining-metadata-and-full-text-queries][advanced searching tutorial]], it would require using ~org-search-view~ with a query with specific regular expression syntax, like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  +lisp +{^\*+\s-+TO-READ\s-}
#+END_EXAMPLE

But with =org-ql= or =org-agenda-ng=, you would write:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-agenda-ng
    (and (regexp "lisp")
         (todo "TO-READ")))
#+END_SRC
