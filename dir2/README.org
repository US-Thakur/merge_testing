** Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      ignore-children
:END:

*** org-ql-search

Read ~QUERY~ and search with ~org-ql~.  Interactively, prompt for these variables:

~BUFFERS-FILES~: ~A~ list of buffers and/or files to search.  Interactively, may also be:

+ ~buffer~: search the current buffer 
+ ~all~: search all Org buffers 
+ ~agenda~: search buffers returned by the function ~org-agenda-files~ 
+ An expression which evaluates to a list of files/buffers 
+ A space-separated list of file or buffer names

~GROUPS~: An ~org-super-agenda~ group set.  See variable ~org-super-agenda-groups~.

~NARROW~: When non-nil, don't widen buffers before searching. Interactively, with prefix, leave narrowed.

~SORT~: One or a list of ~org-ql~ sorting functions, like ~date~ or ~priority~.

*Bindings:* Keys bound in results buffer.
+  =g=: Refresh results.
+  =C-x C-s=: Save query to variable ~org-ql-views~ (accessible with command ~org-ql-view~).

[[images/org-ql-search.gif]]

Here's an example of using it to generate an agenda-like view for certain files in a directory tree:

[[images/org-ql-search-snippet.png]]

*** helm-org-ql

This command displays matches with Helm.  *Note:* Helm is not a package dependency, so this command only works if the package =helm-org= is installed.

Note also that queries in this command are specially handled so that quotes around strings may be omitted for ease of typing.

+  Press =C-x C-s= in the Helm session to save the results to an =org-ql-search= buffer.

[[images/helm-org-ql.gif]]

*** org-ql-view

Choose and display a view stored in ~org-ql-views~.

*** org-ql-view-sidebar

Show a sidebar window listing views stored in =org-ql-views= for easy access.  In the sidebar, press =RET= or =mouse-1= to show the view at point, and press =c= to customize the view at point.

[[images/org-ql-view-sidebar.gif]]

*** org-ql-view-recent-items

Show items in ~FILES~ from last ~DAYS~ days with timestamps of ~TYPE~.  ~TYPE~ may be ~ts~, ~ts-active~, ~ts-inactive~, ~clocked~, ~closed~, ~deadline~, ~planning~, or ~scheduled~.  =FILES= defaults to those returned by the function =org-agenda-files=.

*** org-ql-sparse-tree =(query &key keep-previous (buffer (current-buffer)))=

Show a sparse tree for ~QUERY~ in ~BUFFER~ and return number of results.  The tree will show the lines where the query matches, and any other context defined in ~org-show-context-detail~, which see.

~QUERY~ is an ~org-ql~ query sexp (quoted, since this is a function).  ~BUFFER~ defaults to the current buffer.  When ~KEEP-PREVIOUS~ is non-nil (interactively, with prefix), the outline is not reset to the overview state before finding matches, which allows stacking calls to this command.  Runs ~org-occur-hook~ after making the sparse tree.

** Queries

A query is a lisp form which may contain arbitrary lisp forms, as well as certain built-in predicates.  It is byte-compiled into a predicate function which is tested with point on each heading in an Org buffer; when it returns non-nil, the heading matches the query.

*Notes:*
+  Bare strings like ~"string"~ are automatically converted to ~(regexp "string")~ predicates.
+  Standard numeric comparator function symbols (~<~, ~<=~, ~>~, ~>=~, ~=~ ) need not be quoted when passed as an argument to these predicates.  The resemblance to infix notation is coincidental.  See examples in documentation.

*** Predicates
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      ignore
:END:

Arguments are listed next to predicate names, where applicable.

+  ~category (&optional categories)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading is in one or more of ~CATEGORIES~ (a list of strings).
+  ~children (&optional query)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading has direct child headings.  If ~QUERY~, test it against child headings.  This selector may be nested, e.g. to match grandchild headings.
+  ~descendants (&optional query)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading has descendant headings.  If ~QUERY~, test it against descendant headings.  This selector may be nested (if you can grok the nesting!).
+  ~done~ :: Return non-nil if entry's ~TODO~ keyword is in ~org-done-keywords~.
+  ~habit~ :: Return non-nil if entry is a habit.
+  ~heading (&rest regexps)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry's heading matches all ~REGEXPS~ (regexp strings).
+  ~level (level-or-comparator &optional level)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading's outline level matches arguments.  The following forms are accepted: ~(level NUMBER)~: Matches if heading level is ~NUMBER~.  ~(level NUMBER NUMBER)~: Matches if heading level is equal to or between NUMBERs.  ~(level COMPARATOR NUMBER)~: Matches if heading level compares to ~NUMBER~ with ~COMPARATOR~.  ~COMPARATOR~ may be ~<~, ~<=~, ~>~, or ~>=~.
+  =path (&rest regexps)= :: Return non-nil if current heading's buffer's filename path matches any of =REGEXPS= (regexp strings).  Without arguments, return non-nil if buffer is file-backed.
+  ~priority (&optional comparator-or-priority priority)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading has a certain priority.  ~COMPARATOR-OR-PRIORITY~ should be either a comparator function, like ~<=~, or a priority string, like "A" (in which case (~=~ will be the comparator).  If ~COMPARATOR-OR-PRIORITY~ is a comparator, ~PRIORITY~ should be a priority string.  If both arguments are nil, return non-nil if heading has any defined priority.
+  ~property (property &optional value)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry has ~PROPERTY~ (a string), and optionally ~VALUE~ (a string).  Note that property inheritance is currently /not/ enabled for this predicate.  If you need to test with inheritance, you could use a custom predicate form, like ~(org-entry-get (point) "PROPERTY" 'inherit)~.
+  ~regexp (&rest regexps)~ :: Return non-nil if current entry matches all of ~REGEXPS~ (regexp strings).  Matches against entire entry, from beginning of its heading to the next heading.
+  ~tags (&optional tags)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading has one or more of ~TAGS~ (a list of strings).  Tests both inherited and local tags.
+  =tags-inherited (&optional tags)= :: Return non-nil if current heading's inherited tags include one or more of =TAGS= (a list of strings).  If TAGS is nil, return non-nil if heading has any inherited tags.
     -  Aliases: =inherited-tags=, =tags-i=, =itags=.
+  =tags-local (&optional tags)= :: Return non-nil if current heading's local tags include one or more of =TAGS= (a list of strings).  If TAGS is nil, return non-nil if heading has any local tags.
     -  Aliases: =local-tags=, =tags-l=, =ltags=.
+  =tags-all (tags)= :: Return non-nil if current heading includes all of =TAGS=.  Tests both inherited and local tags.
     -  Aliases: =tags&=.
+  ~todo (&optional keywords)~ :: Return non-nil if current heading is a ~TODO~ item.  With ~KEYWORDS~, return non-nil if its keyword is one of ~KEYWORDS~ (a list of strings).  When called without arguments, only matches non-done tasks (i.e. does not match keywords in ~org-done-keywords~).

*** Date/time predicates
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      ignore
:END:

All of these predicates take optional keyword arguments ~:from~, ~:to:~, and ~:on~:

+  If ~:from~, return non-nil if entry has a timestamp on or after ~:from~.
+  If ~:to~, return non-nil if entry has a timestamp on or before ~:to~.
+  If ~:on~, return non-nil if entry has a timestamp on date ~:on~.

Argument values should be either a number of days (positive to look forward, or negative to look backward), a ~ts~ struct, or a string parseable by ~parse-time-string~ (the string may omit the time value).

*Predicates:*
+  ~ts~ :: Return non-nil if current entry has a timestamp in given period.  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry has any timestamp.
+  ~ts-active~, ~ts-a~ :: Like ~ts~, but only matches active timestamps.
+  ~ts-inactive~, ~ts-i~ :: Like ~ts~, but only matches inactive timestamps.

The following predicates, in addition to the keyword arguments, can also take a single argument, a number, which looks backward or forward a number of days.  The number can be negative to invert the direction.

*Backward-looking:*
+  ~clocked~ :: Return non-nil if current entry was clocked in given period.  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry was clocked at any time.  Note: Clock entries are expected to be clocked out.  Currently clocked entries (i.e. with unclosed timestamp ranges) are ignored.
+  ~closed~ :: Return non-nil if current entry was closed in given period.  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry was closed at any time.

*Forward-looking:*
+  ~deadline~ :: Return non-nil if current entry has deadline in given period.  If argument is =auto=, return non-nil if entry has deadline within =org-deadline-warning-days=.  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry has any deadline.
+  ~planning~ :: Return non-nil if current entry has planning timestamp in given period (i.e. its deadline, scheduled, or closed timestamp).  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry is scheduled at any time.
+  ~scheduled~ :: Return non-nil if current entry is scheduled in given period.  If no arguments are specified, return non-nil if entry is scheduled at any time.

:TOC:      ignore-children
:END:

*** Agenda-like views

**** Function: ~org-ql-block~

For use as a custom agenda block type in ~org-agenda-custom-commands~.  For example, you could define a custom series command like this, which would list all priority A items tagged =Emacs= with to-do keyword =SOMEDAY=, followed by the standard agenda view, in a single buffer:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        '(("ces" "Custom: Agenda and Emacs SOMEDAY [#A] items"
           ((org-ql-block '(and (todo "SOMEDAY")
                                (tags "Emacs")
                                (priority "A"))
                          ((org-ql-block-header "SOMEDAY :Emacs: High-priority")))
            (agenda)))))
#+END_SRC

Which would be equivalent to a ~tags-todo~ search like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        '(("ces" "Custom: Agenda and Emacs SOMEDAY [#A] items"
           ((tags-todo "PRIORITY=\"A\"+Emacs/!SOMEDAY")
            (agenda)))))
#+END_SRC

However, the ~org-ql-block~ version runs in about 1/5th the time.

The variable =org-ql-block-header= may be bound to a string to use as the block header, otherwise the header is formed automatically.

**** Macro: ~org-ql-agenda~

This macro is like ~org-ql~, but it presents matching entries in an Agenda-like view.  It's compatible with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][org-super-agenda]], which provides grouping.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-ql-agenda "~/src/emacs/org-super-agenda/test/test.org"
    (and (or (ts-active :on today)
             (deadline auto)
             (scheduled :to today))
         (not (done)))
    :title "My Agenda View"
    ;; The `org-super-agenda-groups' setting is used automatically when set, or it
    ;; may be overriden by specifying it here:
    :super-groups ((:name "Bills"
                          :tag "bills")
                   (:todo ("SOMEDAY" "TO-READ" "CHECK" "TO-WATCH" "WATCHING")
                          :order 7)
                   (:name "Personal"
                          :habit t
                          :tag "personal"
                          :order 3)
                   (:todo "WAITING"
                          :order 6)
                   (:priority "A" :order 1)
                   (:priority "B" :order 2)
                   (:priority "C" :order 2)))
#+END_SRC

Which presents this buffer:

[[images/screenshot.png]]

*Note:* The view buffer is currently put in ~org-agenda-mode~, which means that /some/ Org Agenda commands work, such as jumping to entries and changing item priorities (without necessarily updating the view).  This feature is experimental and not guaranteed to work correctly with all commands.  (It works to the extent it does because the appropriate text properties are placed on each item, imitating an Agenda buffer.)

Here are some other examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Show an agenda-like view of items in "~/org/main.org" with TODO and
  ;; SOMEDAY keywords which are tagged "computer" or "Emacs" and in the
  ;; category "main":
  (org-ql-agenda "~/org/main.org"
    (and (todo "TODO" "SOMEDAY")
         (tags "computer" "Emacs")
         (category "main")))

  ;; Show an agenda-like view of all habits in all agenda files:
  (org-ql-agenda
    (habit))

  ;; Show an agenda-like view similar to a "traditional" Org Agenda with
  ;; Log Mode turned on.
  (org-ql-agenda
    (or (and (not (done))
             (or (habit)
                 (deadline auto)
                 (scheduled :to today)
                 (ts-active :on today)))
        (closed :on today))
    :sort (date priority todo))
#+END_SRC

*** Listing / acting-on results

**** Function: ~org-ql-select~

/Arguments:/ ~(buffers-or-files query &key action narrow sort)~

Return items matching ~QUERY~ in ~BUFFERS-OR-FILES~.

~BUFFERS-OR-FILES~ is a one or a list of files and/or buffers.

~QUERY~ is an ~org-ql~ query sexp (quoted, since this is a function).

~ACTION~ is a function which is called on each matching entry with point at the beginning of its heading.  It may be:

  - ~element~ or nil: Equivalent to ~org-element-headline-parser~.

  - ~element-with-markers~: Equivalent to calling ~org-element-headline-parser~, with markers added using ~org-ql--add-markers~.  Suitable for formatting with ~org-ql-agenda--format-element~, allowing insertion into an Org Agenda-like buffer.

  - A sexp, which will be byte-compiled into a lambda function.

  - A function symbol.

If ~NARROW~ is non-nil, buffers are not widened (the default is to widen and search the entire buffer).

~SORT~ is either nil, in which case items are not sorted; or one or a list of defined ~org-ql~ sorting methods (~date~, ~deadline~, ~scheduled~, ~todo~, ~priority~, or ~random~); or a user-defined comparator function that accepts two items as arguments and returns nil or non-nil.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Return list of to-do headings in inbox file with tags and to-do keywords:
  (org-ql-select "~/org/inbox.org"
    '(todo)
    :action #'org-get-heading)
  ;; => ("TODO Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound  :personal:" ...)

  ;; Without tags and to-do keywords:
  (org-ql-select "~/org/inbox.org"
    '(todo)
    :action '(org-get-heading t t))
  ;; => ("Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound" ...)

  ;; Return WAITING heading elements in agenda files:
  (org-ql-select (org-agenda-files)
    '(todo "WAITING")
    :action 'element)
  ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)

  ;; Since `element' is the default for ACTION, it may be omitted:
  (org-ql-select (org-agenda-files)
    '(todo "WAITING"))
  ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)
#+END_SRC

**** Function: ~org-ql-query~

/Arguments:/ ~(&key (select 'element-with-markers) from where order-by narrow)~

Like ~org-ql-select~, but arguments are named more like a ~SQL~ query.

+  ~SELECT~ corresponds to the ~org-ql-select~ argument ~ACTION~.
+  ~FROM~ corresponds to the ~org-ql-select~ argument ~BUFFERS-OR-FILES~.
+  ~WHERE~ corresponds to the ~org-ql-select~ argument ~QUERY~.
+  ~ORDER-BY~ corresponds to the ~org-ql-select~ argument ~SORT~, which see.
+  ~NARROW~ corresponds to the ~org-ql-select~ argument ~NARROW~.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Return list of to-do headings in inbox file with tags and to-do keywords:
  (org-ql-query
    :select #'org-get-heading
    :from "~/org/inbox.org"
    :where '(todo))
  ;; => ("TODO Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound  :personal:" ...)

  ;; Without tags and to-do keywords:
  (org-ql-query
    :select '(org-get-heading t t)
    :from "~/org/inbox.org"
    :where '(todo))
  ;; => ("Practice leaping tall buildings in a single bound" ...)

  ;; Return WAITING heading elements in agenda files:
  (org-ql-query
    :select 'element
    :from (org-agenda-files)
    :where '(todo "WAITING"))
  ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)

  ;; Since `element' is the default for SELECT, it may be omitted:
  (org-ql-query
    :from (org-agenda-files)
    :where '(todo "WAITING"))
  ;; => ((headline (:raw-value "Visit the moon" ...) ...) ...)
#+END_SRC

**** Macro: ~org-ql~

/Arguments:/ ~(buffers-or-files query &key sort narrow markers action)~

Expands into a call to ~org-ql-select~ with the same arguments.  For convenience, arguments should be unquoted.

/Note:/ Breaking changes may be made before version 1.0, but in the event of major changes, attempts at backward compatibility will be made with obsolescence declarations, translation of arguments, etc.  Users who need stability guarantees before 1.0 may choose to use tagged stable releases.

** 0.3-pre

*Added*
+  Command =helm-org-ql=.
+  Command =org-ql-sparse-tree=, like =org-sparse-tree= for =org-ql= queries.  (Thanks to [[https://github.com/akirak][Akira Komamura]].)
+  Command =org-ql-view-sidebar=.
+  Per-buffer, per-heading tag caching, which increases the speed of tags-related queries by 6-7x.
+  More tags-related predicates and aliases:
     -  For inherited tags: =tags-inherited=, =inherited-tags=, =tags-i=, =itags=.
     -  For heading-local tags: =tags-local=, =local-tags=, =tags-l=, =ltags=.
     -  =tags-all=, =tags&=: Matches all given tags using boolean =AND= (rather than boolean =OR=, which the =tags= predicate uses).
+  Variable =org-ql-block-header=, which overrides the default header in =org-ql-block= agenda blocks.
+  Predicate =(path)=.
+  Option =org-ql-views= may now be customized in a guided, structured way with the customization UI (e.g. =M-x customize-option RET org-ql-views RET=, or press =c= in the =org-ql-view-sidebar= buffer).
+  Enable more Org Agenda commands in =org-ql-view= buffers (e.g. setting deadlines and scheduling).  (Fixes [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/35][#35]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/mz-pdm][Milan Zamazal]] and [[https://github.com/mskorzhinskiy][Mikhail Skorzhinskii]].)
+  Function =org-ql-select='s =buffers-files= argument can be a function which returns a list of buffers and/or files.

*Changed*
+  Predicate =heading= now accepts multiple regexps, which are matched with boolean =AND=.
+  Predicate =regexp= now matches its regexp arguments with boolean =AND=.
+  Package =org-super-agenda= is now a dependency.  This removes the need for awkward code to handle the case where it's not installed, and makes grouping features always available.  Of course, the global minor mode =org-super-agenda-mode= is not activated by =org-ql=, so no behavior is changed in Org Agenda or =org-ql=; it only means that commands like =org-ql-search= will always provide grouping when called with the appropriate arguments.

*Removed*
+  Macro =org-ql-agenda=.  Instead, use function =org-ql-search=.  See also command =org-ql-view=, etc.

*Fixed*
+  Predicate =heading= now matches only against heading text, i.e. not including tags at the end of the line, to-do keyword, etc.
+  Predicate =todo= now matches case-sensitively, avoiding non-todo-keyword matches (e.g. a heading which begins =Waiting on= will no longer match for a todo keyword =WAITING=).

*Internal*
+  Refactored code from file =org-ql-agenda.el= into files =org-ql-search.el= and =org-ql-view.el=.  Function and variable names have been changed accordingly.

** 0.2.3

*Fixed*
+  Priority queries could fail to match headings whose to-do keywords had non-alphabetic characters, like =TO-READ=.

** 0.2.2

*Fixed*
+  =(deadline auto)= selector matched entries whose deadlines had a warning period that had not yet been entered (=org-deadline-warning-days= too soon).

** 0.2.1

*Fixed*
+  =(descendants)= selector matched against parent heading instead of only descendants.

*Added*
+  Function ~org-ql-query~, like ~org-ql-select~ but with arguments named more like a SQL query.
+  Bare strings like ~"string"~ can be used in queries, which are converted to ~(regexp "string")~ automatically.
+  Selector ~(regexp)~ accepts multiple regexps to test.
+  Macro ~org-ql~ and functions ~org-ql-query~ and ~org-ql-select~ now also accept a comparator function in their ~:sort~ argument.
+  Function ~org-ql-block~, which works as an Org Agenda series/composite/block command, usable in custom agenda commands defined in variable ~org-agenda-custom-commands~.  (Inspired by [[https://github.com/pestctrl/emacs-config/blob/84c557982a860e86d6f67976a82ea776a7bd2c7a/config-org-new.org#my-own-agenda-renderer][Benson Chu's config]].)
+  Function ~org-ql-agenda--agenda~ optionally takes a list of entries as an argument.
+  Selectors ~ts-a~ and ~ts-i~, aliases for ~ts-active~ and ~ts-inactive~.
+  Selector ~ts~ now accepts a ~:type~ argument.
+  Face =org-ql-agenda-due-date=.
+  Selectors ~(children)~ and ~(descendants)~.
+  Function ~org-ql-search~ and macro ~org-ql-agenda~ accept a ~:title~ argument, which is displayed in the header.
+  Command ~org-ql-search~ offers global ~org-super-agenda-groups~ in completion.
+  Customization group ~org-ql~.
+  Command ~org-ql-view~, which displays views saved to variable ~org-ql-views~, which can be saved from ~org-ql-search~ buffers with command ~org-ql-search-save~, which is bound to =C-x C-s= in view buffers.
+  Variable ~org-ql-view-map~, active in view buffers displayed by ~org-ql-search~, ~org-ql-agenda~, and ~org-ql-view~.
+  =random= sort method.
+  Save position when refreshing search buffers.

*Changed*
+  Function ~org-ql-query~ renamed to ~org-ql-select~.  ~org-ql-query~ now refers to a new function.
+  Macro ~org-ql~ no longer accepts a ~:markers~ argument.  Instead, use argument ~:action element-with-markers~.  See function ~org-ql-select~, which ~org-ql~ calls.
+  Selector ~(todo)~ no longer matches "done" keywords when used without arguments (i.e. the ones in variable ~org-done-keywords~).
+  Overhauled date/time-based predicates.  See documentation for new argument signatures.

*Removed*
+  Selector ~(date)~, replaced by ~(ts)~.

*Fixed*
+  Handle date ranges in date-based selectors.  (Thanks to [[https://github.com/codygman][Cody Goodman]], [[https://github.com/swflint][Samuel W. Flint]], and [[https://github.com/vikasrawal][Vikas Rawal]].)
+  Don't overwrite bindings in =org-agenda-mode-map=.
+  Don't search buffers without headings, and show a message if the user attempts it.
+  Don't search hidden/special buffers.
+  Properly accept arbitrary sort functions in =org-ql-select=, etc.  (Fixes [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/37][#37]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/mz-pdm][Milan Zamazal]].)
+  Planning-line-related predicates searched too far into entries.
+  Add autoloads.  (Fixes [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/pull/36/files#][#36]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/akirak][Akira Komamura]].)

*Compatibility*
+  Fixes for compatibility with Org 9.2.  (Thanks to [[https://github.com/ataias][Ataias Pereira Reis]] and [[https://github.com/dakra][Daniel Kraus]].)

*Internal*
+  Optimizations for some query selectors, e.g. =regexp= and =todo=.  These can provide a significant improvement for some queries.  See benchmarks in [[file:notes.org][notes.org]].
+  Library [[https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el][ts]] is now used for parsing and comparing timestamps.

** Comparison with Org Agenda searches

Of course, queries like these can already be written with Org Agenda searches, but the syntax can be complex.  For example, this query would be difficult to write in a standard Org Agenda search, because it matches against a to-do keyword /and/ a plain-text search.  As described in the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html#combining-metadata-and-full-text-queries][advanced searching tutorial]], it would require using ~org-search-view~ with a query with specific regular expression syntax, like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  +lisp +{^\*+\s-+TO-READ\s-}
#+END_EXAMPLE

But with ~org-ql-agenda~, you would write:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-ql-agenda
    (and (regexp "lisp")
         (todo "TO-READ")))
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Use async

If ~org-ql~ is loaded byte-compiled, the argument lists are not named properly (not sure why, as ~help-function-arglist~ is supposed to handle that).  We could run the function in another Emacs process with ~async~ to avoid this.
